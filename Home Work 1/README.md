Run the code and reproduce the data preprocessing and classification modeling steps.  
 
- `Q1 (Reproduce): Please read, understand, run the code and reproduce the model accuracies. Please briefly explain whether you can reproduce the classification accuracies of  'Support Vector Machines', 'KNN', 'Logistic Regression',  'Random Forest', 'Naive Bayes', 'Perceptron', 'Stochastic Gradient Decent', 'Linear SVC', 'Decision Tree'. (10 points)`
 
- `Q2 (Improve): Is the data preprocessing process proposed in the Kaggle post the best preprocessing solution? If yes, please explain why. If not, can you leverage what you learned in the class and your previous experiences to improve data processing, to obtain better accuracies for all these classification models? Describe what is your improved data preprocessing, and what are your improved accuracies?  (16 points)`
